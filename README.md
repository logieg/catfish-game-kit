# Catfish Game Kit

A small and simple collection of tools and libraries to build games with HTML5 and JavaScript.

Created as a personal project to make it easier to create games without using external libraries or engines, and also as a challenege to myself to learn and use the skills and knowledge necessary to create a functional game toolkit.

## Finding Your Way Around

The libraries folder contains useful libraries for drawing on an HTML5 canvas, working with sprites, controlling a player, implementing physics and events, and managing collisions.

The tools folder contains a few simple tools to complement the libraries, such as a spritesheet generator, game template generator, and more.

The documentation folder contains documentation for the libraries, generated by documentation.js.  It will be immensely helpful if you want to make anything of significance with this toolkit.

## Usage

If you use this game kit to create something, please let me know!  I'd love to see what you can do.  Feel free to use all the tools and libraries as much as you want, and for anything you want, but make sure to credit me if you include any of my code in your project.
